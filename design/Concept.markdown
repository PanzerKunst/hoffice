# Index page

The index page has a full-width picture with a color processing à la Agigen. "Hoffice" is written in the middle of that image, in white.
At the top right of this picture, is a hamburger menu button, which when clicked displays a full-screen menu à la Agigen.

Below the full-width picture, is a list of pages. Each list item is clickable, and composed of:

* A 4/3 image thumbnail representing the page
* The title of the page, below the thumbnail

The list items are displayed so that on wide screens, there are 3 per row (less on smaller screens).

Below this list of page thumbnails, is a list of posts. Each post is a thumbmail + title + date. The posts are displayed from the more recent (left) to the oldest (right).
The background color is not white anymore, but a strong background color, possibly the same as the full-width picture at the top. The post titles are displayed in white.

Only the 3 most recent posts are displayed by default, but it's possible to display the older ones. On a wide screen, it's done via a carousel. On a small screen, it's done thanks to a "Load more" link.

Below that is a black footer containing the contact info.


# Pages and posts

Each page starts with a full-width picture, but in true colors this time. The Hoffice logo is on the top left, and the menu on the top right (same as on the index page). The page title is written in the middle of the image, in white.

Below, is the page's text, over write background.

Same footer as in the index page.
